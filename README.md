### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**timD27/timD27** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my education.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything in coding.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about soccer.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: youÂ´ll find a way.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Github makes me feel dump.
--> LetÂ´s change this.
